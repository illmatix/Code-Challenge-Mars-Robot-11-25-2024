# Code Challenge: Mars Robot

Welcome to the **Mars Robot Code Challenge** repository! This project simulates the movement of a robot on a Mars-like plateau, processing commands to move the robot and turn it left or right. The goal is to execute the robot's commands while staying within the boundaries of the plateau.

---

## Features
- Define a plateau grid for the robot to navigate.
- Simulate a robot's movement, turning, and stopping.
- Input command sequences to control the robot.
- Prevent the robot from falling off the plateau.
