# Code Challenge: Mars Robot

Welcome to the **Mars Robot Code Challenge** repository! This project simulates the movement of a robot on a Mars-like plateau, processing commands to move the robot and turn it left or right. The goal is to execute the robot's commands while staying within the boundaries of the plateau.

---

## Features
- Define a plateau grid for the robot to navigate with optional boundary enforcement.
- Simulate a robot's movement, turning, and stopping.
- Input command sequences to control the robot.
- Prevent the robot from falling off the plateau when boundaries are enabled.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/illmatix/Code-Challenge-Mars-Robot-11-25-2024.git
   cd Code-Challenge-Mars-Robot-11-25-2024
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Program
Run the program using: 
`npm start` 

You will be prompted to define boundary enforcement:

- Enable boundaries: Enter yes to enforce boundaries, and then specify the maximum boundary limit for both axes.
- Disable boundaries: Enter no to allow the robot to move without restrictions.

### Input
The program accepts the following commands, which can be entered in lowercase or uppercase:

* L: Turn the robot left.
* R: Turn the robot right.
* M: Move the robot forward in its current direction.
* ?: Display help instructions.
* Q: Quit the program.

Additionally, pressing CTRL-C will shut down the program.
